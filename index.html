Opening his garage for business in just a week's time, he needed a logo, branded social media content and a variety of informative/ promotional signage designing ASAP!
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="carousel__info align-right">Through our initial consultation with Ryan we came to understand the passion and enthusiasm he and his team at Auto’s & Repair have for providing an efficient and reliable service. This was our inspiration behind the logo! By fading into the logo we have been able to mirror the efficiency of Auto’s & Repairs service in addition to conjoining the two letters to resemble the strength and reliability of Ryan's team. 
                                    </p>
                            <p class="carousel__info align-left">In addition to a sleek new logo design, you can go check out the signage we designed for Auto’s & Repair over on our instagram <a class="popout__link" href="https://www.instagram.com/anomalous_content_design/">@anomalous_content_design.</a> </p>

                            <p class="carousel__info align-left">PhysioSurge specialises in the use of Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy to aid in the recovery of water sport injuries. Hayley, the “SURGE”, behind PhysioSurge, came to Anomalous in need of a complete brand design in time for her business  launch. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="carousel__info align-right">Speaking with Hayley allowed our design team to get a better understanding of the brand, its values and the vision for its future. From this we had a clear grasp of Hayley’s passion for the ocean and it’s healing powers. This was our inspiration for her logo! PhysoSurge’s new logo encompasses the power of the ocean throughout, whilst still clearly outlining the service that Hayley provides.
                            </p>
                            <p class="carousel__info align-left">Anomalous have continued to work with PhysioSurge and are now in the process of developing a custom website to display their top quality service to prospective clients. We believe this is a great way to provide a platform for PhysioSurge. They are able to  demonstrate their services and credentials as well as give clients all the information they need to book an appointment.</p>

                            <p class="carousel__info align-left">Mindful Movements with Niamh is an Instagram page zoning in on the importance of being mindful in everyday life by practicing Yoga and meditation.  We started our branding  journey with Niahm who requested a logo to be designed in order for her to launch her business page.
                            </p>
                            <p class="carousel__info align-right">After further consultation with Niamh, we understood the direction she wished to take her brand. She required a zen style logo that is representative of her image. Using this information we drafted some preliminary designs focused around peaceful symbols. The final logo is centred around a lily and a full moon. These tranquil symbols are now the face of Mindful Movements. The black and gold colour scheme makes this logo jump from the screen and is keeping with Mindful Movements calming spirit and being. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="carousel__info align-left">Further to a logo design Anomalous have continued the branding journey with Niamh by providing support with the editing and branding of promotional videos. This process is ongoing and has so far resulted in the development of promotional videos live on @mindfulmovements_withniamh (this is a link) Check them out!</p>

                                <p class="carousel__info align-left">Jack is documenting the renovation of a 200 year old house to over 300,000 followers on Tiktok! As part of the renovation of ‘Grandad’s House’ Jack came to Anomalous for a logo which portrayed the history of the building and the hard work he has put into renovating it. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="carousel__info align-right">After a detailed discussion with Jack we were able to understand his desire to utilise the property within the new logo as a homage to his family heritage held within the building. The modernisation of the traditional house through the use of colour has been reflected throughout the logo design. Strong bold colours have been used to symbolise the history of the property with a vibrant undertone also being used to illustrate its modern twist. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="carousel__info align-left">In addition to Jack's new logo design, Anomalous have been able to further assist him with the creation of branded signage, stationary and social media posts. Jack's unique presence on social media gave a dynamic variety to his branding requirements. For this reason we also produced a short tutorial tiktok video which was in keeping with his existing brand image. </p>
                                <p class="carousel__info align-right">All of Jack’s designs can be found on our instagram <a class="popout__link" href="https://www.instagram.com/anomalous_content_design/">@anomalous_content_design</a> and also find <a class="popout__link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jackshelly8?lang=en">Jack’s Tiktok</a> page here.</p>
